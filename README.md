# CrossWords
I created crosswords puzzle browser game in Javascript language using lit-html.js to render pages and  page.js to navigate between pages. 
For backend i use server providet to me by my menthors in Softuni. The game make fetch requests to login and to get questions and answers. 
I create my own design using css, and add responsive design to look good as well on smartphone devices.
I have upload backend on Heroku.com and for frontend i use Firebase.
